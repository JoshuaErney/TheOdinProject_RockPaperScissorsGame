// Step #1 - Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.

// Step #2 - Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

// Bonus Points: Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive.

// Bonus Points: Account for TIES by re-playing the round.

// Step #3 - Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a best-of-five game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
